Why use BC2?
============

We specialise in buying income streams (income payable over a period of
years in the future).  We purchase fixed or variable income streams,
which may continue for a fixed term or for a variable term – for example
for the lifetime of a particular person. However unusual or abstruse the
proposition, we’ll consider it.

We have capital available to invest, and we will consider income streams
of £1,000 pa and above.

Who should use us?
=================

For trustees in bankruptcy and other insolvency professionals, selling
an income stream to us for a capital sum enables you to finalise the
case and close your file.

For beneficiaries under a trust fund entitled to an income for life, we
will purchase that from you for a capital sum.
